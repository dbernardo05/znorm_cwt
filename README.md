# znorm_cwt
Z-normalization of CWT

This function enhances visual inspection of continuous wavelet transform in brain activity, by rectifying the 1/f spectral behavior of the EEG. First, a Gaussian distribution is fitted on the Morlet coefficients at each scale of the CWT. Then, the normalized, z-scaled wavelet power spectrum was defined as the absolute value-squared of the z-scored wavelet coefficients. This method was first described by Roehri et al. and is similar to the implementation used in Bernardo et al.
